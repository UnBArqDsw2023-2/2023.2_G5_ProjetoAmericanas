## Contributing Policies

1. Branch Names
   
Use descriptive names for branches (e.g., feature/new-login-page).

2. Branch Creation
Create a branch for every new feature or bugfix.
Ensure an associated issue or user story exists before creating a branch.

3. Commit patterns

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/pt-br/v1.0.0/) for commit specification.

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```
The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

-  fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
-  feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
-  BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
-  types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention) recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
-  footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.

4. Issue Tracking
Connect each branch to a specific issue or user story.

5. Pull Request (PR)

Follow the PR process:
- Conduct a code review.
- Test your changes.

6. Code Quality
  Maintain coding standards.
  Include tests.
  Run code linters.

7. Documentation
